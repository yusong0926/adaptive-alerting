### How the Travis CI build works

We use Travis CI to build AA Docker images and push them to Docker Hub. Here's how it works:

- A developer pushes a branch (`master` or otherwise) to GitHub.
- GitHub kicks off a Travis CI build.
- Travis CI reads `.travis.yml`, which drives the build.
- `.travis.yml` invokes the top-level `Makefile`.
- The top-level `Makefile`
  - runs a Maven build for the whole project
  - invokes module-specific `Makefile`s to handle building and releasing Docker images
- Each module-specific `Makefile` runs one or more module-specific build scripts to
  - build the Docker images
  - release the Docker images
- For the release (docker push), the module-specific build script delegates to the shared
  `scripts/publish-to-docker-hub.sh` script. This script has logic to push the image to Docker Hub
  if and only if the current branch is the `master`.
